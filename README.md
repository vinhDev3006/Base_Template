# Base Up-to-Date Android Project Template

This repository project offers a fully configured Android project setup, focusing on the essentials of modern Android development. Android development often requires careful configuration and constant updating of dependencies. This template eliminates that setup burden by providing a pre-configured project with the most current libraries, allowing developers to focus on building app features immediately.

This template is designed to simplify Android app development, providing a ready-to-use environment with the latest configurations of Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material 3, ViewModel, Navigation, Room, and KSP.


- **Kotlin**: Leverage the powerful features of Kotlin, including concise syntax and null safety, with version `2.0.20`.
- **Jetpack Compose with Material 3**: Build responsive, modern UIs with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 design components. 
- **ViewModel**: Manage UI-related data with lifecycle awareness using Jetpack ViewModel.
- **Navigation**: Simplified in-app navigation with Compose Navigation.
- **Room**: Load prepopulate data or store data with Room database, pre-configured for integration with Kotlin..
- **KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing)**: Modern annotation processing tool integrated for faster build times, migrating from KAPT.


This template is based on the tutorial for Googleâ€™s [Inventory Tracking App](https://github.com/google-developer-training/basic-android-kotlin-compose-training-inventory-app.git).
